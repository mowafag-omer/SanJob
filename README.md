# SanJob

## Project Description

My project is a job board platform that connects job seekers with companies. There are two types of users:

- The first user is the job seeker. The platform allows them to create an account and a profile where they can add their personal information, contact details, field of specialty, and upload their CV. They can browse job offers on the platform and apply for them. They also have the ability to view their applications and check their status, such as whether the recruiter has viewed their application.

- The second user is the recruiter (the company). The platform allows them to create an account and a profile so that they can post job offers. They can then view applications and candidate profiles, and choose to accept, reject or put them in process. Communication between the employer and candidate will take place outside the platform.
